"Me personally I love Microsoft and the new features that they are coming out with. Anytime you have a problem you can always go to support or go to your control panel or search the question in Microsoft and they have tons of answers for all your problems and they have also all types of solutions. All you have to do is ask as far as the comment made by the person with the display my comment was not directed just to you personally it was directed to everyone as a whole. So don't take my response personally I'm just trying to help you with some advice and anyone else you may need that same advice.Back to Microsoft and all its new features. I think they're growing and and enabling us to grow with them and we're learning so much more through them. So look for the positive! We can always find negative in anything we do if that's what we're looking for... we want to try to find the positive. We all need to learn how to be happy with what we have and to grow with today's society, economy, and Technology very important! So everybody have a great day and enjoy your experiences and learn from your mistakes... it makes it so much more worth it and so much more fun.Have a great day everyone!!!😇👣�🤗💥💕",0

My biggest fear is that Microsoft will eventually force users to stop using the old device. 😮   I sure pray that does not become the case.

"Rene Delgado 4.2 Tera flops for $399 is not a bad upgrade at all. I currently run my PS4 Pro at 1080p and a strong 60 FPS, and it's crisp. By no means will it come close to native 4k, or even upscale 4k at 60 FPS, but a GPU setup that runs 4k at all will set you back a pretty penny, especially at that speed. Less expensive setups in SLI are still more expensive than a PS4 pro, and that's just for the GPU hardware and bridge.  The 10 bit coloring is amazing, but still would've  liked to have seen the 12 bit Dolby Vision support instead of just HDR10. Sony is not going bankrupt at all, in fact they have moved the Playstation devision to a standalone company almost a year ago. And Microsoft is by no means the largest PC distributor. Lenovo currently holds that title, followed by Hewlett Packard and Dell. Microsoft actually only distributes 2 PCs, the Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book so maybe you live on a different planet. They are merely a software company. One thing I do wish my PS4 Pro had that Microsoft did right was the UHD-BD player, especially because when I think of Blu-ray I think of Sony. ✌",0

We also need to promote better transportation so citizens call go to jobs easily. For that we need to improve our infrastructure and build train 🚂 system. A train system takes less space, carries extraordinary large numbers of passengers and goods and services with very less investments. It also helps the environment.

If you lose access to domains you once had prey that whoever owns the new domains that they don't have a caught-all-mailbox because you'll loose your life, Microsoft entitlements, access to your one drive and if you have Windows 10 you'll be locked out of your computer. Because it will take 30 days for your account to update with new security information all the while notifying the domains on file your intent take control of YOUR account. That's right 30 days! Want to purchase stuff from the store nope sorry you can't because they've blocked access to credit cards they have on file. All in the name of protecting your account. 😒 Thanks Microsoft for allowing a hacker to take over my account!",0

"I use to teach bowling to adults and to children also. I had a league of special needs children, one of the best things that I ever did, I loved how that even if one of the kids would throw the ball into the gutter , the other children would high five them or hug them and tell them good one. Such great sports they all were.To bad we can't all be so kind.Loved this, they could teach us all a lot. 💕💕",0

"Dont buy Microsoft Surface, their customer service sucks. I have a Surface, the screen is lousy, easily cracked, filed my complaint, the staff initially told me the replacement would cost RM1300. And they will give new replacement. So sudden changed it to RM2300 and mentioned that the replacement is a refurbished item. Hanky panky. I think Microsoft Surface team is facing financial problem. I hope this company(Microsoft Surface) will close down.I am really disappointed, please DO NOT BUY.👎👎👎",0

People need to grow up if you don't like a certainty company keep your opinion to your self because the world really doesn't care. If you don't buy the product than keep it to your self if you don't want to see the product again keep it to your self. People don't tell you they hate you because you have an android phone or a windows phone and if you actually put into perspective all the phones and different OS look pretty close to the same, same color layout, same transparency shades on specific things, same product colors.",0

"Soooo...    ...Now onto Windows 10, you say. I hope Windows 10, is like Windows 7. Because Windows 8, has been nothing but a new version of vista, in that they both are horrible. 😞 I'm so very disappointed in Microsoft software these days. You need to stop completely changing your system and software already. It's annoying.I would also like to see Microsoft get with hardware manufactures and convince them to install a memory chip on all hardware with a driver / software bin,rar or zip file on the actual hardware device. Thus, when installing any Windows operating system. Windows would recognize all devices as flash drives, at first. Then access them for the drivers/software.Simple forward and backward, system restores or installs. Secondly, have all motherboards require a direct solid state drive for just Windows operating systems to be flashed too. Basically like an XBOX. Windows would be protected from viruses by a simple program that monitors the file structure of the main ss hdd drive. If files are modified. The next reboot, sets the files back to factory. All personal files would be on the customers hdd. 😉 Easy!...not to mention, upgrading or replacing a hdd, would be a piece of cake. Your customers could just take out the old hdd and stick in a new one. Done! No drivers to hunt for. No Installation disk needed for Windows to be reinstalled, etc...",0
"Not really what I was saying on the recovery partion, but ok.Having your personal files seperate from the operating system is flawless. All the desktops I build, uses a solid state hdd for Windows, for max speed and a second Hdd, sata drive for personal files.My laptops, run dual partions. Windows on one, Files on the other. What I'm saying, is to have Windows on a memory chip, in it's stock os format, with no way to edit it.All drivers and software on each device, for easy activation and flawless execution. All hidden drives of course. Except via command prompt or even a certified installer accessible, for driver / software updates.Lastly Windows, by default. Stores all programs and files on the second Hdd. 😉I fix broken laptops and desktops, I buy from computer tech stores and It techs, who say they are for parts or repair only. Lmao 😄Needless to say. I know a bit about fixing errors on hardware and software. 😉",0

"Hey Windows 8 ® Microsoft ™ , guess what? Not everyone has a tablet. And for those of us who still operate on an actual computer, Live Tiles are kind of retarded. And while we are on the topic of mental retardation, changing ""programs"" to ""apps?"" Who's the target market for this change? The generation of people who grew up using smart phones and tablets but not desktops? That generation doesn't exist, you are moving things backwards. In fact, I'm pretty sure the entire Live Tile screen is a rip off of AOL 96. I've got Sports, and Games, and a Calendar. How about next time you make two versions. Call one Windows and market it to people who know what a keyboard is, and call the other version Playschool's My First Computer for Dummies. The former is a device people use to solve problems and accomplish things at work, and the later can be a vehicle for Angry Birds.",0

"I'm extremely excited!My thoughts on the Windows 8 Consumer Preview:I'm absolutely loving using Metro, and it works well in conjunction with the desktop.It's gonna be superb on a tablet, and it's just the change desktop computing needed. (Not to mention a generational change, much like Windows 95 was.) It makes me legitimately excited, even despite the rough edges on the Metro apps and the tiny tweaks the basic UI needs. The new controls for Mouse and Keyboard are superb, and super efficient. Makes Mouse and Keyboard navigation about as easy as Touch.And, of course, Live Tiles are handy as heck, and the Start Screen brings a much-needed new face to Windows. :)LOVE. ♥",0

"GUd EveNIng !! Welcome to Business Empire RjB's ..Im Proud to introduce to you!! My New Product LIne... Its a OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) .. not a class A ..""BEATS by Dr Dre""http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.237066309682739.59496.230913493631354&type=3&savedArtists and producers work hard in the studio perfecting their sound. But people can't really hear it with normal headphones. Most headphones can't handle the bass, the detail, the dynamics. Bottom line, the music doesn't move you.With Beats, people are going to hear what the artists hear, and listen to the music the way they should: the way I do.It's All About Sound.Beats™ are precision engineered to reveal the full sound of your music, including the most sonically demanding Rock, Hip Hop and R&B. Big, powerful speakers dwarf the sound of standard earbuds and drop the bass low like you're in the club. Proprietary driver technologies wired with Monster™ cable make every track a new music experience with bold, punchy bass and insane clarity.Ultimate listening isn't just what you hear, but what you don't. Monster powered isolation technology cut unwanted external noise, so all you hear is the music.What are OEM products???OEM (original equipment manufacturer) refers to companies that originally make the products for others to repackage and sell(say for example an outsourcing company in China). Resellers(like Beats™ & Monster™) buy OEM products in bulk, minus the costly retail packaging that comes with individually sold units. The product itself is essentially THE SAME as its more expensive, retail-packaged sibling.In short, OEMs are basically the same with their original counterparts - same sound quality, same process but not the same price. The relatively BIIIIGGGG difference with the price comes with those costly product advertising, fancy packaging, add-on materials(cds&manuals), shop rent, etc.So what would you choose? The original that costs tens of thousands of pesos or OEMs with the same sound quality but for 1/10 of the original price? Your choice. Your Music ツ,.. if you want to order Just don't hesitate to Post on my WALL.. and I'll give you the full details.. :D GodbLEss!! ""Music is Amazing w/ BEATS..",0

"Nobody cares? ;)Sorry, but Halo is the only thing Microsoft does that I don't like. Futuristic-based games are not my type. They leave too much to the developers' imagination. Only one I can tolerate is Mass Effect 2, but that's because it's got the mechanics of a modern-time-based game but it has the futuristic look. And because of Yvonne Strahovski. ♥",0
